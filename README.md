SimpleAIS
=========

I needed a simple AIS decoder for a small art project. I couldn't find
one, so I'm making something minimally adequate for my needs. This
code is quite rough, and so shouldn't be used for anything that matters.
It especially shouldn't be used for ship navigation.

Contributions welcome.

My main sort for protocol information is here: http://catb.org/gpsd/AIVDM.html

The protocol checksum is here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183
